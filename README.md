# Deployments

A variety of popular methods for deployment have been added to this project to give you the most flexibility in where you desire hosting your project. If needed, you can clean out non-used hosting aspects, but there is no harm if you leave them. Any gatsby-plugins related to specific hosting types are isolate to **only** run when those hosting ENVs are activated, to help keep your builds as clean as possible for your chosen path. Enjoy!

## Github Pages

## Google's Firebase

## Netlify

# üèóÔ∏è Multi-sites & Environments

Some fine point essentials required for working with Gatsby in the real world, where there of often never a 'single' version of the site in the wild. While at some I hope to externalize these into a gatsby theme include, at the moment they're too tangle and hand-on against project level build requirements.

## [gatsby/env.js](./gatsby/env.js)
Out of the box, one of Gatsby's lacking features is how to best handle working with deploying your project to different sites, which naturally also differ from hosting to hosting too! To help address some of these weak points, in combination with libraries like dotenv-flow (listed below in Features), these files aim to ease the burden or running builds across different sites/branches beyond a single hosting mentality. So when you have the need to spin up a hosted dev/stagin/prod site side by side on different branches, this is where the magic happens. 

A dependable utility, [env](./gatsby/env.js), was created to obtain and deal with ENV variables which might need to affect how you perform your builds.

## [gatsby/logging.js](./gatsby/logging.js)
When leveraging multi-sites as well, detailed build logs of what ENVs are running (like the builds site URL), or just what plugins are actually running on a given site are also lacking in gatsby. 

As such, [logging](./gatsby/logging.js) was created to provide helpers easily display various ENV variables on build when working across different platform, and a list of which gatsby plugins are currently running and what options are enabled (key name, not specifics)

# Project Breakdown

A list of code features and build plugins which have been configured and crafted to get you up and running with ease and consistency.

## üéØ Features

- [dotenv-flow](https://github.com/kerimdzhanov/dotenv-flow) adds support for managing ENV variables with greater control, allowing necessary settings to pass between developers yet still allowing local (ignored) files to take precedence

## üñ•Ô∏è Gatsby Browser
- [wrapRootElement](./gatsby/browser/wrapRootElement.js) will set the `useAppContext` across the root page element in gatsby, so that any component will have access to the global state as needed.

# ‚ö∞Ô∏è Failures and Resolutions
## [gatsby-plugin-root-import](https://github.com/mongkuen/gatsby-plugin-root-import)
> Set Webpack to resolve root, allowing you to import modules from an absolute project path rather than relative ../../ paths.

**Ideal**: Because `import x from '../../../y` paths are a bulls8it standard to live by :P

**The Issue:**<br/>The concept of moving away from awkwardly linked files is desirable, as it can be hard to move files around later in refactors. However, IDE support has no concept of where you're referencing these methods and components from sadly. As such, this breaks the ability to jump to definitions which is a detriment to workflow. So as practical as it is to want a clean manageable way to associate files, it just didn't pan out in actual usage. 

**Resolution:**<br/>While there is a bit of manual effort, a clean viable alternate was found. With components grouped into logicial concerns, i.e `layout`, `media`, `meta`, and the desire to namespace these effectively, it gets verbose targeting `../layout/Layout/Layout` named components.

While module imports don't allow the right flexibility, because Gatsby is based in webpack, we're not limited and can set up a given file to use node style importing with `require` statements.

**Implementation:**<br/>As such, it allows us to create index.js files per component concerns. So for the `layout` component group, we can define:

```js
// components/layout/index.js
import Layout from './Layout/Layout'
import Header  from './Header/Header'

export {
  Layout,
  Header
}
```

Thus, from any components on site, say `pages`, we can easily target these in a clean way without breaking IDE referencing:

```js
// components/pages/index.js
import { Layout } from '../layout' // Assumes the index.js, and pulls the correct component.
```

In the long run, this will help address both concerns on refactoring and inherent IDE support with clean simple pathing.

**Note:** To avoid cyclic dependencies, any components inside the same domain, i.e `layout` folder, must adhere to using local references for imports still, and can't benefit from the index file usage, but it's a small price for the cleanliness this code standard affords else where.
